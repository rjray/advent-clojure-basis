# Advent of Code Clojure Basis

Starter pack for doing [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) in Clojure. This is based almost entirely on Mitchell Hanburg's [Advent of Code Clojure Starter](https://github.com/mhanberg/advent-of-code-clojure-starter). I've renamed a few files and deleted a few, but that's all.

Uses [lein](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

## Usage

There are 25 namespaces, 25 input files, 25 example input files, 25 tests, and 50 `lein` tasks.

1. Fill in the tests with the example solutions.
1. Write your implementation.
1. Fill in the final problem inputs into the `lein` task and run `lein run d01.p1`.

## Installation

I'll put more here as this matures.
